# CPPBricScheduler

This project is designed to work as a Workout Scheduler for Cal Poly Pomona students. This project was built during the 2024 Broncohacks hackathon event where we spend 24 hours creating an application catered towards students of Cal Poly Pomona. This project was a great introduction for our team to get started with the NEXT.js framework as well as the Firebase backend, as well as other basic applications of git and web dev. We also implmented a method of creating scheudles using ChatGPT via LangChain and the ability to receive a schedule by submitting a form based on questions regarding a person's avability and goals for working out.

The features we were able to implment include creating an account as well as storing custom schedules on the database. Future plans would have included account login as well as updating features and other visual aspects to reflect a user's personal account to show that they are logged in.

Note: All keys used are no longer active and all firebase apps have been deleted.
